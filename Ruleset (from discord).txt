Turn order:
1. Draw a card, gain 1 max mana and refresh mana pool.
2. Main phase, in which you can:
 - Redraw a card
 - Sacrifice up to one card
 - Play your cards
- Activate cards' abilities
3. Combat phase, in which your units attack.
4. End turn.

When you end a turn, your cards automatically attack damaging either
	the target ahead of them, or the enemy player
	
To play a card, click on it, then click one of the 5 spaces that make up
	the front row of the blue half of the board to place the card there
	
Once per turn you may click on a card in your hand then click the "redraw"
	button to replace it with a new card
	
In this build all cards are generated randomly on a cost curve with stats
	randomly distributed from a stat total determined by the card's cost.
